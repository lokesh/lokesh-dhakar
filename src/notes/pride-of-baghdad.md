A short, page-turner of a graphic novel that follows four lions who escape from the Baghdad zoo during the US bombing. The story is a fable in the vain of [Animal Farm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7613.Animal_Farm?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=8NojKB1OYo&rank=1) or [Maus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15195.The_Complete_Maus), that asks questions about liberation and self-determination. It packs a lot in a sub-one-hour read and ends with a punch to the gut. I couldn't put it down once I started.

The writing is paired with amazing artwork by Niko Henrichon. His renderings of the lions, which are naturalistic, and never overly anthropomorphized, are incredible. If these weren't done well, it could have been a distraction.

This was my first time reading a comic through the Hoopla Digital service, which is kindly provided for free by my local San Francisco Public Library. The comic viewer has an interesting mode called _action view_. When enabled, it incrementally reveals the content of each page and slides you between panels. It's jarring at first, but the focus it provides, and the dramatic effect it can achieve when it shifts you from a small panel to a double-page spread, made the reading experience more engaging and dynamic for me.
