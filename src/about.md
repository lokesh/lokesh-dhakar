I work on the Design Engineering team at [Square](//square.com) in San Francisco. Previously I worked at [Getaround](https://www.getaround.com/) as the Engineering Lead of the Web Team. See my full work history at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lokeshdhakar).

I created the original [Lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) script many years ago. More recently I created [Color Thief](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/). See all my open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/lokesh).

I take photos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/lokesh), post designs on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/lokesh), and track my runs and bike rides on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1136437).
