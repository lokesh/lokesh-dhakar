### What I'm up to now

A full stack designer based in [Glasgow](//square.com) but working remotely. A knowledge sponge, Notion wiz and master of auto layout. I craft sleek 0 to 1 experiences that deliver maximum impact with bare essentials.

When I'm not staring at screens, I'm usually busy with Ashtanga yoga, my Frenchie and collecting notes.

Latest portfolio of work available upon request.
