His story is one of challenges growing up in impoverished conditions in the inner-city, and we get a surface level view of it, but I think there was an opportunity to go deeper here. Though the crew was mostly stand-offish, I wish there was more quiet time between them and the subjects where they they were able to get them to open up. In the end, the documentary paints an unflattering picture of the family, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s completely fair.</p>\n<p>As for the dirt bike riding, I&#39;m into it. Minus the overly risky behavior like runnind reds at full speed and antagonizing the police, the rest is just an outlet that gives them a sense of freedom and joy. In a way, it reminds me of the fixed gear bike scene.</p>\n",

Two points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Love vs Hate</u>: You can attempt to resolve issues with peaceful protest (MLK) or violence in certain scenarios (Malcom X). In this case, Mookie yells &quot;Hate&quot; before throwing the trashcan in to the pizzeria. Spike Lee makes the case that the latter approach is now necessary to bring on change. And Mookie&#39;s action is a reaction to bigger societal issues, issues that trump his relationship w/Sal&#39;s. </li>\n<li><u>Police killing of Radio Raheem</u>: Raheem is killed a minute prior in the movie by a chokehold from the police. But suddenly, our concern has shifted to the destruction of Sal&#39;s pizzeria.

      "excerpt": "<p>A documentary that follows John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey over a couple of day during the 1960 primary election. The reason I sought it out is that it&apos;s noted as one of the movies that helped develop the then nascent <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Cinema\">Direct Cinema</a></em> movement. This is a type of documentary filmmaking where the filmmakers don&apos;t participate in the action, instead they let the story play out and develop independently, rather than coming to the project with a narrative in mind or constructing one retroactively. There is something raw and honest about this process that makes this style of documentary very intimate.</p>"
